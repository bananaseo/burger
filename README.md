# burger app

1. I largely depended on the cat activity 
2. Moving the burgers around from ready-made to devoured works.
3. Post is not working 
4. Heroku- I had a lot of trouble with Heroku. Installing Heroku CLI didn't work, so I resorted to using npm install -g heroku. I know using this npm is not good. I will sort it out during office hours.
